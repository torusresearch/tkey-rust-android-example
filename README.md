# Tkey Rust Android Example

This project is an example Android application demonstrating the usage of the tKey library in an Android environment. tKey is a library that provides threshold  key management for decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Torus network.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio: Install the latest version of Android Studio, which is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android development.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/torusresearch/tkey-rust-android-example.git
   ```
2. Open Android Studio and select "Open an existing Android Studio project."

3. Navigate to the cloned directory and select the tkey-rust-android-example folder.

4. Let Android Studio build the project and download any necessary dependencies.

### Usage
Connect your Android device to your development machine or use an emulator.

In Android Studio, click on the "Run" button or use the shortcut Shift + F10 to build and run the application.

The application will be installed and launched on your device or emulator. You can now explore the functionality of the tKey library in the app.

### Customization
The example project provides a basic implementation of using the tKey library.

Modify the UI: Update the user interface to match your application's design and requirements.

Implement additional functionality: Extend the example project to include more features and interactions with the Tkey Rust library.

Integrate with other libraries or APIs: If your application requires integration with other libraries or APIs, you can incorporate them into this project.
